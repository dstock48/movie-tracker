## About
This was our first project incorporating Redux to manage the state of our React projects. The goal was to retrieve the new movie release data from The Movie Database and create a front-end to display the movies in a grid interface with details about the movie such as the movie poster, title, rating, genres. The app had to handle multiple user accounts with the ability to log in and out, and the ability for users to mark movies as favorites which get saved to a database and linked to the user that favorited it.
